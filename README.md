# MySQL Data Analysis Project – Layoffs Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a real-world layoffs dataset using **MySQL**.
The goal was to prepare raw Excel/CSV data and extract meaningful insights using SQL queries.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: layoffs.csv
- Contains company-wise layoff data including industry, country, date, and number of employees laid off.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL
- Excel (for initial dataset)
- SQL (Data Cleaning & EDA)

## 🔹 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized text fields
- Handled NULL and missing values
